# Datastax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra速

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.datastax.oss/java-driver-core/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.datastax.oss/java-driver-core)

*If you're reading this on github.com, please note that this is the readme for the development 
version and that some features described here might not yet have been released. You can find the
documentation for latest version through [DataStax Docs] or via the release tags, e.g. 
[4.6.1](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/tree/4.6.1).*

A modern, feature-rich and highly tunable Java client library for [Apache Cassandra速] \(2.1+) and 
[DataStax Enterprise] \(4.7+), and [DataStax Apollo], using exclusively Cassandra's binary protocol 
and Cassandra Query Language (CQL) v3.

## Getting the driver

The driver artifacts are published in Maven central, under the group id [com.datastax.oss]; there
are multiple modules, all prefixed with `java-driver-`.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-core</artifactId>
  <version>${driver.version}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-query-builder</artifactId>
  <version>${driver.version}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-mapper-runtime</artifactId>
  <version>${driver.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Note that the query builder is now published as a separate artifact, you'll need to add the
dependency if you plan to use it.

Refer to each module's manual for more details ([core](manual/core/), [query
builder](manual/query_builder/), [mapper](manual/mapper)).

## Compatibility

The driver is compatible with Apache Cassandra速 2.1 and higher, DataStax Enterprise 4.7 and
higher, and DataStax Apollo.

It requires Java 8 or higher.

Disclaimer: Some DataStax/DataStax Enterprise products might partially work on big-endian systems,
but DataStax does not officially support these systems.

## Migrating from previous versions

Java driver 4 is **not binary compatible** with previous versions. However, most of the concepts
remain unchanged, and the new API will look very familiar to 2.x and 3.x users.

See the [upgrade guide](upgrade_guide/) for details.
