## Features

This part of the documentation is organized into sub-sections covering
specific topics.

If you're reading this from the [generated HTML documentation on
github.io](http://datastax.github.io/java-driver/), use the "Read More"
menu on the right hand side. If you're [browsing the source files on
github.com](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/tree/2.0/features),
simply navigate to each sub-directory.

This is a work in progress: new sections will be added to cover existing
features or document new ones.

You can also find more help in the legacy
[user documentation](http://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/2.0/java-driver/whatsNew2.html)
on the DataStax website.
