== SetEntity methods

Annotate a DAO method with https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/mapper/annotations/SetEntity.html[@SetEntity] to fill a core driver data structure from an link:../../entities[Entity]:

[source,java]
----
public interface ProductDao {
  @SetEntity
  BoundStatement bind(Product product, BoundStatement boundStatement);
}
----

The generated code will set each entity property on the target, such as:

[source,java]
----
boundStatement = boundStatement.set("id", product.getId(), UUID.class);
boundStatement = boundStatement.set("description", product.getDescription(), String.class);
...
----

It does not perform a query.
Instead, those methods are intended for cases where you will execute the query yourself, and just need the conversion logic.

=== Lenient mode

By default, the mapper operates in "strict" mode: the target statement must contain a matching column for every property in the entity definition, _except computed ones_.
If such a column is not found, an error will be thrown.

Starting with driver 4.12.0, the `@SetEntity` annotation has a new `lenient` attribute.
If this attribute is explicitly set to `true`, the mapper will operate in "lenient" mode: all entity properties that have a matching column in the target statement will be set.
However, _unmatched properties will be left untouched_.

As an example to illustrate how lenient mode works, assume that we have the following entity and DAO:

[source,java]
----
@Entity class Product {

  @PartitionKey int id;
  String description;
  float price;
  // other members omitted
}

interface ProductDao {

  @SetEntity(lenient = true)
  BoundStatement setLenient(Product product, BoundStatement stmt);

}
----

Then the following code would be possible:

[source,java]
----
Product product = new Product(1, "scented candle", 12.99);
// stmt does not contain the price column
BoundStatement stmt = session.prepare("INSERT INTO product (id, description) VALUES (?, ?)").bind();
stmt = productDao.setLenient(product, stmt);
----

Since no `price` column was found in the target statement, `product.price` wasn't read (if the statement is executed, the resulting row in the database will have a price of zero).
Without lenient mode, the code above would throw an error instead.

Lenient mode allows to achieve the equivalent of driver 3.x https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.10/manual/object_mapper/using/#manual-mapping[manual mapping feature].

*Beware that lenient mode may result in incomplete rows being inserted in the database.*

=== Parameters

The method must have two parameters: one is the entity instance, the other must be a subtype of https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/data/SettableByName.html[SettableByName] (the most likely candidates are https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/BoundStatement.html[BoundStatement], https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/BoundStatementBuilder.html[BoundStatementBuilder] and https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/data/UdtValue.html[UdtValue]).
Note that you can't use https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/data/SettableByName.html[SettableByName] itself.

The order of the parameters does not matter.

The annotation can define a link:../null_saving/[null saving strategy] that applies to the properties of the object to set.
This is only really useful with bound statements (or bound statement builders): if the target is a https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/data/UdtValue.html[UdtValue], the driver sends null fields in the serialized form anyway, so both strategies are equivalent.

=== Return type

The method can either be void, or return the exact same type as its settable parameter.

[source,java]
----
@SetEntity
void bind(Product product, UdtValue udtValue);

@SetEntity
void bind(Product product, BoundStatementBuilder builder);
----

Note that if the settable parameter is immutable, the method should return a new instance, because the generated code won't be able to modify the argument in place.
This is the case for https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/BoundStatement.html[BoundStatement], which is immutable in the driver:

[source,java]
----
// Wrong: statement won't be modified
@SetEntity
void bind(Product product, BoundStatement statement);

// Do this instead:
@SetEntity
BoundStatement bind(Product product, BoundStatement statement);
----

If you use a void method with https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/BoundStatement.html[BoundStatement], the mapper processor will issue a compile-time warning.
