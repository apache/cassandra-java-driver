= Schema builder

The schema builder is an additional API provided by link:../[java-driver-query-builder] that enables one to *generate CQL DDL queries programmatically**.
For example it could be used to:

* based on application configuration, generate schema queries instead of building CQL strings by hand.
* given a Java class that represents a table, view, or user defined type, generate representative schema DDL `CREATE` queries.

Here is an example that demonstrates creating a keyspace and a table using https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/querybuilder/SchemaBuilder.html[SchemaBuilder]:

[source,java]
----
import static com.datastax.oss.driver.api.querybuilder.SchemaBuilder.*;

try (CqlSession session = CqlSession.builder().build()) {
  CreateKeyspace createKs = createKeyspace("cycling").withSimpleStrategy(1);
  session.execute(createKs.build());

  CreateTable createTable =
      createTable("cycling", "cyclist_name")
          .withPartitionKey("id", DataTypes.UUID)
          .withColumn("lastname", DataTypes.TEXT)
          .withColumn("firstname", DataTypes.TEXT);

  session.execute(createTable.build());
}

The link:../#general-concepts[general concepts] and link:../#non-goals[non goals] defined for the query builder also apply for the schema builder.

=== Building DDL Queries

The schema builder offers functionality for creating, altering and dropping elements of a CQL schema.
