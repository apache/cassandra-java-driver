== Implicit execution

Instead of passing traversals to the driver, you can create a _remote traversal source_ connected to the DSE cluster:

[source,java]
----
CqlSession session = CqlSession.builder().build();

GraphTraversalSource g =
    AnonymousTraversalSource.traversal().withRemote(DseGraph.remoteConnectionBuilder(session).build());
----

Then build traversals from that source.
Whenever you reach a http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#terminal-steps[terminal step] (such as `next()`, `toList()`...), the DSE driver will be invoked under the covers:

[source,java]
----
List<Vertex> vertices = g.V().has("name", "marko").toList();
----

This lets you use the traversal as if it were working against a local graph;
all the communication with DSE is done transparently.
Note however that the returned objects (vertices, edges...) are completely _detached_: even though they contain the complete data, modifications made to them will not be reflected on the server side.

Traversal sources with different configurations can easily be created through execution profiles in the link:../../../../configuration/[configuration]:

----
datastax-java-driver {
  profiles {
    graph-oltp {
      basic.graph.traversal-source = a
      basic.graph.timeout = 30 seconds
    }
  }
}
----

Pass the profile name to the remote connection builder:

[source,java]
----
GraphTraversalSource a = AnonymousTraversalSource.traversal().withRemote(
    DseGraph.remoteConnectionBuilder(session)
        .withExecutionProfileName("graph-oltp")
        .build());
----
