== GraalVM native images

=== Quick overview

* https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[GraalVM native images] can be built with  no additional configuration starting with driver 4.13.0.
* But extra configurations are required in a few cases:
 ** When using link:../reactive[reactive programming];
 ** When using link:../integration#Jackson[Jackson];
 ** When using LZ4 link:../compression/[compression];
 ** Depending on the link:../logging[logging backend] in use.
* DSE-specific features:
 ** link:../dse/geotypes[Geospatial types] are supported.
 ** link:../dse/graph[DSE Graph] is not officially supported, although it may work.
* The link:../shaded_jar[shaded jar] is not officially supported, although it may work.

=== Concepts

Starting with version 4.13.0, the driver ships with https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/BuildConfiguration/#embedding-a-configuration-file[embedded GraalVM configuration files] that  allow GraalVM native images including the driver to be built without hassle, barring a few  exceptions and caveats listed below.

=== Classes instantiated by reflection

The driver instantiates its components by reflection.
The actual classes that will be instantiated  in this way need to be registered for reflection.
All built-in implementations of various driver  components, such as `LoadBalancingPolicy` or `TimestampGenerator`, are automatically registered for  reflection, along with a few other internal components tha are also instantiated by reflection.
_You don't need to manually register any of these built-in implementations_.

But if you intend to use a custom implementation in lieu of a driver built-in class, then it is your  responsibility to register that custom implementation for reflection.

For example, assuming that you have the following load balancing policy implementation:

[source,java]
----

package com.example.app;

import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.context.DriverContext;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.metadata.Node;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.loadbalancing.DefaultLoadBalancingPolicy;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.UUID;

public class CustomLoadBalancingPolicy extends DefaultLoadBalancingPolicy {

  public CustomLoadBalancingPolicy(DriverContext context, String profileName) {
    super(context, profileName);
  }
  // rest of class omitted for brevity
}
----

And assuming that you declared the above class in your application.conf file as follows:

[,hocon]
----
datastax-java-driver.basic{
  load-balancing-policy.class = com.example.app.CustomLoadBalancingPolicy
}
----

Then you will have to register that class for reflection:

. Create the following reflection.json file, or add the entry to an existing file:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name": "com.example.app.CustomLoadBalancingPolicy", "allPublicConstructors": true }
]
----

. When invoking the native image builder, add a `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection.json` flag and point it to the file created above.

NOTE: some frameworks allow you to simplify the registration process.
For example, Quarkus offers the `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.RegisterForReflection` annotation that you can use to annotate your class:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterForReflection
public class CustomLoadBalancingPolicy extends DefaultLoadBalancingPolicy {
  //...
}
----

In this case, no other manual configuration is required for the above class to be correctly  registered for reflection.

=== Configuration resources

The default driver link:../configuration[configuration] mechanism is based on the TypeSafe Config library.
TypeSafe Config looks for a few classpath resources when initializing the configuration:  `reference.conf`, `application.conf`, `application.json`, `application.properties`.
_These classpath  resources are all automatically included in the native image: you should not need to do it  manually_.
See https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Resources/[Accessing Resources in Native Images] for more information on how classpath  resources are handled in native images.

=== Configuring the logging backend

When configuring link:../logging[logging], the choice of a backend must be considered carefully, as  most logging backends resort to reflection during their configuration phase.

By default, GraalVM native images provide support for the java.util.logging (JUL) backend.
See  https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Logging/[this page] for more information.

For other logging backends, please refer to the logging library documentation to find out if GraalVM  native images are supported.

=== Using reactive-style programming

The link:../reactive[reactive execution model] is compatible with GraalVM native images, but the following configurations must be added:

. Create the following reflection.json file, or add the entry to an existing file:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name": "org.reactivestreams.Publisher" }
]
----

. When invoking the native image builder, add a `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection.json` flag and point it to the file created above.

=== Using the Jackson JSON library

https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] is used in link:../integration#jackson[a few places] in  the driver, but is an optional dependency;
if you intend to use Jackson, the following  configurations must be added:

. Create the following reflection.json file, or add these entries to an existing file:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name": "com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser" },
  { "name": "com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper" }
]
----

IMPORTANT: when using the shaded jar -- which is not officially supported on GraalVM native  images, see below for more details -- replace the above entries with the below ones:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name": "com.datastax.oss.driver.shaded.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser" },
  { "name": "com.datastax.oss.driver.shaded.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper" }
]
----

. When invoking the native image builder, add a `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection.json` flag and point it to the file created above.

=== Enabling compression

When using link:../compression/[compression], only LZ4 can be enabled in native images.
*Snappy compression is not supported.*

In order for LZ4 compression to work in a native image, the following additional GraalVM configuration is required:

. Create the following reflection.json file, or add these entries to an existing file:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Compressor" },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4JNICompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4JavaSafeCompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4JavaUnsafeCompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4HCJavaSafeCompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4HCJavaUnsafeCompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4JavaSafeSafeDecompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4JavaSafeFastDecompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4JavaUnsafeSafeDecompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  },
  {
    "name" : "net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4JavaUnsafeFastDecompressor",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicFields": true
  }
]
----

. When invoking the native image builder, add a `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection.json` flag and point it to the file created above.

=== Native calls

The driver performs a few link:../integration#native-libraries[native calls] using  https://github.com/jnr[JNR].

Starting with driver 4.7.0, native calls are also possible in a GraalVM native image, without any extra configuration.

=== Using DataStax Enterprise (DSE) features

==== DSE Geospatial types

DSE link:../dse/geotypes[Geospatial types] are supported on GraalVM native images;
the following configurations must be added:

. Create the following reflection.json file, or add the entry to an existing file:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name": "com.esri.core.geometry.ogc.OGCGeometry" }
]
----

IMPORTANT: when using the shaded jar -- which is not officially supported on GraalVM native  images, as stated above -- replace the above entry with the below one:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name": "com.datastax.oss.driver.shaded.esri.core.geometry.ogc.OGCGeometry" }
]
----

. When invoking the native image builder, add a `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection.json` flag and point it to the file created above.

==== DSE Graph

*link:../dse/graph[DSE Graph] is not officially supported on GraalVM native images.*

The following configuration can be used as a starting point for users wishing to build a native image for a DSE Graph application.
DataStax does not guarantee however that the below configuration will work in all cases.
If the native image build fails, a good option is to use GraalVM's https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Agent/[Tracing Agent] to understand why.

. Create the following reflection.json file, or add these entries to an existing file:

[,json]
----
[
  { "name": "org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerIoRegistryV3d0" },
  { "name": "org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.dsl.graph.GraphTraversal" },
  { "name": "org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.Graph",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicConstructors": true,
    "allDeclaredMethods": true,
    "allPublicMethods": true
  },
  { "name": "org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerGraph",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicConstructors": true,
    "allDeclaredMethods": true,
    "allPublicMethods": true
  },
  { "name": " org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.util.empty.EmptyGraph",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicConstructors": true,
    "allDeclaredMethods": true,
    "allPublicMethods": true
  },
  { "name": "org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.dsl.graph.GraphTraversalSource",
    "allDeclaredConstructors": true,
    "allPublicConstructors": true,
    "allDeclaredMethods": true,
    "allPublicMethods": true
  }
]
----

. When invoking the native image builder, add the following flags:

----
-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflection.json
--initialize-at-build-time=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerIoRegistryV3d0
--initialize-at-build-time=org.apache.tinkerpop.shaded.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDeserializer
----

=== Using the shaded jar

*The link:../shaded_jar[shaded jar] is not officially supported in a GraalVM native image.*

However, it has been reported that the shaded jar can be included in a GraalVM native image as a drop-in replacement for the regular driver jar for simple applications, without any extra GraalVM configuration.
