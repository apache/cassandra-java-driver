# Contributing guidelines

## Working on an issue

Before starting to work on something, please comment in JIRA or ask on the mailing list
to make sure nobody else is working on it.

If a fix applies both to 2.0 and 2.1, work on the 2.0 branch, your commit will eventually
get merged in 2.1.

Before you send your pull request, make sure that:

- you have a unit test that failed before the fix and succeeds after.
- the fix is mentioned in `driver-core/CHANGELOG.rst`.
- the commit message include the reference of the JIRA ticket for automatic linking
  (example: `Fix NPE when a connection fails during pool construction (JAVA-503).`).

As long as your pull request is not merged, it's OK to rebase your branch and push with
`--force`.

If you want to contribute but don't have a specific issue in mind, the [lhf](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&jqlQuery=project%20%3D%20JAVA%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20lhf)
label in JIRA is a good place to start: it marks "low hanging fruits" that don't require
in-depth knowledge of the codebase.

## Editor configuration

### General

We consider automatic formatting as a help, not a crutch. Sometimes it makes sense to
break the rules to make the code more readable, for instance aligning columns (see the
constant declarations in `DataType.Name` for an example of this).

**Please do not reformat whole files, only the lines that you have added or modified**.


### Eclipse

Formatter:

- Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter.
- Click "Import".
- Select `src/main/config/ide/eclipse-formatter.xml`.

Import order:

- Preferences > Java > Code Style > Organize imports.
- Click "Import".
- Select `src/main/config/ide/eclipse.importorder`.

Prevent trailing whitespaces:

- Preferences > Java > Editor > Save Actions.
- Check "Perform the selected actions on save".
- Ensure "Format source code" and "Organize imports" are unchecked.
- Check "Additional actions".
- Click "Configure".
- In the "Code Organizing" tab, check "Remove trailing whitespace" and "All lines".
- Click "OK" (the text area should only have one action "Remove trailing white spaces").


### IntelliJ IDEA

- File > Import Settings...
- Select `src/main/config/ide/intellij-code-style.jar`.

This should add a new Code Style scheme called "java-driver".

## Running the tests

We use TestNG. There are 3 test categories:

- "unit": pure Java unit tests.
- "short" and "long": integration tests that launch Cassandra instances.

The Maven build uses profiles named after the categories to choose which tests to run:

```
mvn test -Pshort
```

The default is "unit". Each profile runs the ones before it ("short" runs unit, etc.)

Integration tests use [CCM](https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm) to bootstrap Cassandra instances.
Two Maven properties control its execution:

- `cassandra.version`: the Cassandra version. This has a default value in the root POM,
  you can override it on the command line (`-Dcassandra.version=...`).
- `ipprefix`: the prefix of the IP addresses that the Cassandra instances will bind to (see
  below). This defaults to `127.0.1.`.


CCM launches multiple Cassandra instances on localhost by binding to different addresses. The
driver uses up to 6 different instances (127.0.1.1 to 127.0.1.6 with the default prefix).
You'll need to define loopback aliases for this to work, on Mac OS X your can do it with:

```
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.1.1 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.1.2 up
...
```
