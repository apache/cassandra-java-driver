    <description>Common classes for testing Java Driver in an OSGi container.</description>

    <!--
        This submodule holds the common test classes for the shaded and unshaded osgi tests.
        Since each testing submodule uses a different version of driver-core, each copies
        these common classes into it's build-dir and recompiles them with the correct driver
        artifact. This is required because MailboxImpl uses dropwizard classes that may or
        may not be shaded. In order for the shaded/unshaded classes on the classpath to match
        those referenced in the compiled .class files we need the correct driver-core
        dependency loaded at compile-time, hence why each submodule must recompile the common
        test code.
