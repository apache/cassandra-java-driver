## Authentication

Cassandraâ€™s binary protocol supports [SASL]-based authentication.  To enable it, use
[Cluster.Builder.withCredentials] when building your `Cluster` instance to provide the credentials
you wish to authenticate with:

```java
Cluster.builder()
  .withCredentials("bob", "mypassword")
  .build();
```

This is a shortcut for using [PlainTextAuthProvider] for simple username/password authentication
(intended to work with the server-side `PasswordAuthenticator`).  This may alternatively be
provided using the [Cluster.Builder.withAuthProvider] method:


```java
Cluster.builder()
  .withAuthProvider(new PlainTextAuthProvider("bob", "mypassword"))
  .build();
```

Authentication must be configured before opening a session, it cannot be changed at runtime.

You can also write your own provider; it must implement [AuthProvider].
