# OSGi

The driver is available as an [OSGi] bundle. More specifically, 
the following Maven artifacts are actually valid OSGi bundles:

- `driver-core`
- `driver-mapping`
- `driver-extras`

## Including the driver in your OSGi application

We have complete examples demonstrating usage of the driver in an OSGi
environment; please refer to our [OSGi examples repository].
