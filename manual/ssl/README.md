## SSL

You can secure traffic between the driver and Cassandra with SSL. There
are two aspects to that:

* **client-to-node encryption**, where the traffic is encrypted, and the
  client verifies the identity of the Cassandra nodes it connects to;
* optionally, **client certificate authentication**, where Cassandra
  nodes also verify the identity of the client.

This section describes the driver-side configuration; it assumes that
you've already configured SSL in Cassandra:

* [the Cassandra documentation](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/security/secureSSLClientToNode_t.html)
  covers a basic approach with self-signed certificates, which is fine
  for development and tests.
* [this blog post](http://thelastpickle.com/blog/2015/09/30/hardening-cassandra-step-by-step-part-1-server-to-server.html)
  details a more advanced solution based on a Certificate Authority
  (CA).

### Preparing the certificates

#### Client truststore

This is required for client-to-node encryption.

If you're using self-signed certificates, you need to export the public
part of each node's certificate from that node's keystore:

```
keytool -export -alias cassandra -file cassandranode0.cer -keystore .keystore
```

Then add all public certificates to the client truststore:

```
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias <cassandra_node0> -file cassandranode0.cer -keystore client.truststore
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias <cassandra_node1> -file cassandranode1.cer -keystore client.truststore
...
```

If you're using a Certificate Authority, the client truststore only
needs to contain the CA's certificate:

```
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias CARoot -file ca.cer -keystore client.truststore
```

#### Client keystore

If you also intend to use client certificate authentication, generate
the public and private key pair for the client:

```
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias client -keystore client.keystore
```

If you're using self-signed certificates, extract the public part of the
client certificate, and import it in the truststore of each Cassandra
node:

```
keytool -export -alias client -file client.cer -keystore client.keystore
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias client -file client.cer -keystore server.truststore
```

If you're using a CA, sign the client certificate with it (see the blog
post linked at the top of this page). Then the nodes' truststores only
need to contain the CA's certificate (which should already be the case
if you've followed the steps for inter-node encryption).

### Driver configuration

#### Property-based

`withSSL()` gives you a basic JSSE configuration:

```java
Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder()
  .addContactPoint("127.0.0.1")
  .withSSL()
  .build();
```

You can then use
[JSSE system properties](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Customization)
for specific details, like keystore locations and passwords:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/client.truststore
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password123
# If you're using client authentication:
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/client.keystore
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password123
```

#### Programmatic

If you need more control than what system properties allow, you can
configure SSL programmatically by creating an [SSLOptions] instance:

```java
SSLContext sslContext = ... // create and configure SSL context
String[] cipherSuites = ...

SSLOptions sslOptions = new SSLOptions(sslContext, cipherSuites);

Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder()
  .addContactPoint("127.0.0.1")
  .withSSL(sslOptions)
  .build();
```

A known limitation of the current API is that you can't customize the
`SSLEngine`, which prevents advanced features like hostname
verification. This will be fixed in 3.0 (see
[JAVA-841](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-841)), in the
meantime see below for a workaround.


### Bypassing `SSLOptions`

For advanced use cases, it's possible to bypass `SSLOptions` entirely:
since the driver provides a hook into the Netty pipeline (by way of
[NettyOptions]), you can add the SSL handler yourself:

```java
import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine;

// Base implementation: each time a connection is established, create an SSL handler
// and add it to the pipeline:
public abstract class SslNettyOptions extends NettyOptions {
  @Override
  public void afterChannelInitialized(SocketChannel channel) throws Exception {
    channel.pipeline().addFirst("ssl", createSslHandler(channel));
  }

  protected abstract SslHandler createSslHandler(SocketChannel channel);
}

// Concrete implementation based on JSSE
public class MyNettyOptions extends SslNettyOptions {

  private final SSLContext sslContext = createContext();

  protected SslHandler createSslHandler(SocketChannel channel) {
    return new SslHandler(createEngine(sslContext, channel));
  }

  private static SSLContext createContext() {
    ... // create and configure context
  }

  private static SSLEngine createEngine(SSLContext sslContext, SocketChannel channel) {
    SSLEngine engine = sslContext.createSSLEngine();
    engine.setUseClientMode(true);
    ... // any extra configuration
    return engine;
  }
}

cluster = Cluster.builder()
  .addContactPoint("127.0.0.1")
  .withNettyOptions(new MyNettyOptions())
  .build();
```

This could be used for the following use cases:

* fine control over JSSE configuration, for example tuning the SSL
  engine for hostname verification;
* bypassing JSSE altogether in favor of another SSL implementation:
  recent Netty versions support
  [OpenSSL](http://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html)
  for improved performance.
