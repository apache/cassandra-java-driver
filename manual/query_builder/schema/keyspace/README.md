## Keyspace

A keyspace is a top-level namespace that defines a name, replication strategy and configurable
options. [SchemaBuilder] offers API methods for creating, altering and dropping keyspaces.

### Creating a Keyspace (CREATE KEYSPACE)

To start a `CREATE KEYSPACE` query, use `createKeyspace` in [SchemaBuilder]:

```java
import static com.datastax.oss.driver.api.querybuilder.SchemaBuilder.*;

CreateKeyspaceStart create = createKeyspace("cycling");
```

Like all other `CREATE` queries, one may supply `ifNotExists()` to require that the keyspace should
only be created if it doesn't already exist, i.e.:

```java
CreateKeyspaceStart create = createKeyspace("cycling").ifNotExists();
```

Note that, at this stage, the query cannot be completed yet.  You need to provide at least a
replication strategy.  The two most widely used ones are SimpleStrategy and NetworkTopologyStrategy.

To provide a replication strategy, use one of the following API methods on `CreateKeyspaceStart`:

* `withSimpleStrategy(int replicationFactor)`
* `withNetworkTopologyStrategy(Map<String, Integer> replications)`
* `withReplicationOptions(Map<String, Object> replicationOptions)`

For example, the following builds a completed `CreateKeyspace` using `NetworkTopologyStrategy` with
a replication factor of 2 in `east` and 3 in `west`:

```java
CreateKeyspace create = createKeyspace("cycling")
    .withNetworkTopologyStrategy(ImmutableMap.of("east", 2, "west", 3));
// CREATE KEYSPACE cycling WITH replication={'class':'NetworkTopologyStrategy','east':2,'west':3}
```

Optionally, once a replication factor is provided, one may provide additional configuration when
creating a keyspace:

* `withDurableWrites(boolean durableWrites)`
* `withOption(String name, Object value)`

### Altering a Keyspace (ALTER KEYSPACE)

To start an `ALTER KEYSPACE` query, use `alterKeyspace`:

```java
AlterKeyspaceStart alterKeyspace = alterKeyspace("cycling");
```

From here, you can modify the keyspace's replication and other settings:

* `withSimpleStrategy(int replicationFactor)`
* `withNetworkTopologyStrategy(Map<String, Integer> replications)`
* `withReplicationOptions(Map<String, Object> replicationOptions)`
* `withDurableWrites(boolean durableWrites)`
* `withOption(String name, Object value)`

At least one of these operations must be used to return a completed `AlterKeyspace`, i.e.:

```java
alterKeyspace("cycling").withDurableWrites(true);
// ALTER KEYSPACE cycling WITH durable_writes=true
```

### Dropping a keyspace (DROP KEYSPACE)

To create a `DROP KEYSPACE` query, use `dropKeyspace`:

```java
dropKeyspace("cycling");
// DROP KEYSPACE cycling
```

You may also specify `ifExists`:

```java
dropKeyspace("cycling").ifExists();
// DROP KEYSPACE IF EXISTS cycling
```
