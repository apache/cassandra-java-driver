Reference configuration
-----------------------

The following is a copy of the ``reference.conf`` file matching the version of this documentation.
It is packaged in the ``java-driver-core`` JAR artifact, and used at runtime to provide the default
values for all configuration options (in the sources, it can be found under
``core/src/main/resources``).

See the `configuration page <../>`_ for more explanations.
