## Schema metadata

[Metadata#getKeyspaces] returns a client-side representation of the database schema:

```java
Map<CqlIdentifier, KeyspaceMetadata> keyspaces = session.getMetadata().getKeyspaces();
KeyspaceMetadata system = keyspaces.get(CqlIdentifier.fromCql("system"));
System.out.println("The system keyspace contains the following tables:");
for (TableMetadata table : system.getTables().values()) {
  System.out.printf(
      "  %s (%d columns)%n", table.getName().asCql(true), table.getColumns().size());
}
```

Schema metadata is fully immutable (both the map and all the objects it contains). It represents a
snapshot of the database at the time of the last metadata refresh, and is consistent with the
[token map](../token/) of its parent `Metadata` object. Keep in mind that `Metadata` is itself
immutable; if you need to get the latest schema, be sure to call
`session.getMetadata().getKeyspaces()` again (and not just `getKeyspaces()` on a stale `Metadata`
reference).


### Notifications

If you need to follow schema changes, you don't need to poll the metadata manually; instead,
you can register a listener to get notified when changes occur:

```java
SchemaChangeListener listener =
  new SchemaChangeListenerBase() {
    @Override
    public void onTableCreated(TableMetadata table) {
      System.out.println("New table: " + table.getName().asCql(true));
    }
  };
session.register(listener);

session.execute("CREATE TABLE test.foo (k int PRIMARY KEY)");
```

See [SchemaChangeListener] for the list of available methods. [SchemaChangeListenerBase] is a
convenience implementation with empty methods, for when you only need to override a few of them.


### Configuration

#### Enabling/disabling

You can disable schema metadata globally from the configuration:

```
datastax-java-driver.advanced.metadata.schema.enabled = false
```

If it is disabled at startup, [Metadata#getKeyspaces] will stay empty. If you disable it at runtime,
it will keep the value of the last refresh.

You can achieve the same thing programmatically with [Session#setSchemaMetadataEnabled]: if you call
it with `true` or `false`, it overrides the configuration; if you pass `null`, it reverts to the
value defined in the configuration. One case where that could come in handy is if you are sending a
large number of DDL statements from your code:

```java
// Disable temporarily, we'll do a single refresh once we're done 
session.setSchemaMetadataEnabled(false);

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  session.execute(String.format("CREATE TABLE test.foo%d (k int PRIMARY KEY)", i));
}

session.setSchemaMetadataEnabled(null);
```

Whenever schema metadata was disabled and becomes enabled again (either through the configuration or
the API), a refresh is triggered immediately.


#### Filtering

You can also limit the metadata to a subset of keyspaces: 

```
datastax-java-driver.advanced.metadata.schema.refreshed-keyspaces = [ "users", "products" ]
```

If the property is absent or the list is empty, it is interpreted as "all keyspaces".

Note that, if you change the list at runtime, `onKeyspaceAdded`/`onKeyspaceDropped` will be invoked
on your schema listeners for the newly included/excluded keyspaces. 


#### Schema agreement

Due to the distributed nature of Cassandra, schema changes made on one node might not be immediately
visible to others. If left unaddressed, this could create race conditions when successive queries
get routed to different coordinators: 

```ditaa

      |                    |   unconfigured table foo            |

```

To avoid this issue, the driver waits until all nodes agree on a common schema version:

```ditaa
 Application             Driver             Node 1
------+--------------------+------------------+-----
      |                    |                  |
      |  CREATE TABLE...   |                  |
      |------------------->|                  |
      |                    |   send request   |
      |                    |----------------->|
      |                    |                  |
      |                    |     success      |
      |                    |<-----------------|
      |                    |                  |
      |          /--------------------\       |
      |          :Wait until all nodes+------>|
      |          :agree (or timeout)  :       |
      |          \--------------------/       |
      |                    |        ^         |
      |                    |        |         |
      |                    |        +---------|
      |                    |                  |
      |   complete query   |                  |
      |<-------------------|                  |
      |                    |                  |
```

Schema agreement is checked:
 
* before a schema refresh;
* before completing a successful schema-altering query (like in our example above).

It is done by querying system tables to find out the schema version of all nodes that are currently
UP. If all the versions match, the check succeeds, otherwise it is retried periodically, until a
given timeout. This process is tunable in the driver's configuration:

```
datastax-java-driver.advanced.control-connection.schema-agreement {
  interval = 200 milliseconds
  timeout = 10 seconds
  warn-on-failure = true
}
```

After executing a statement, you can check whether schema agreement was successful or timed out with
[ExecutionInfo#isSchemaInAgreement]:

```java
ResultSet rs = session.execute("CREATE TABLE...");
if (rs.getExecutionInfo().isSchemaInAgreement()) {
  ...
}
```

You can also perform an on-demand check at any time with [Session#checkSchemaAgreementAsync] \(or
its synchronous counterpart):

```java
if (session.checkSchemaAgreement()) {
  ...
}
```

A schema agreement failure is not fatal, but it might produce unexpected results (as explained at
the beginning of this section).


##### Schema agreement in mixed-version clusters

If you're operating a cluster with different major/minor server releases (for example, Cassandra 2.1
and 2.2), schema agreement will never succeed. This is because the way the schema version is
computed changes across releases, so the nodes will report different versions even though they
actually agree (see [JAVA-750] for the technical details).

This issue would be hard to fix in a reliable way, and shouldn't be that much of a problem in
practice anyway: if you're in the middle of a rolling upgrade, you're probably not applying schema
changes at the same time.  


### Relation to token metadata

Some of the data in the [token map](../token/) relies on keyspace metadata (any method that takes a
`CqlIdentifier` argument). If schema metadata is disabled or filtered, token metadata will also be
unavailable for the excluded keyspaces.

### Performing schema updates from the client

If you issue schema-altering requests from the driver (e.g. `session.execute("CREATE TABLE ..")`),
take a look at the [Performance](../../performance/#schema-updates) page for a few tips.
