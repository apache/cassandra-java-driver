## Authentication

### Quick overview

* `advanced.auth-provider` in the configuration.
* disabled by default. Also available: plain-text credentials, or write your own.
* can also be defined programmatically:
  [CqlSession.builder().withAuthCredentials][SessionBuilder.withAuthCredentials] or
  [CqlSession.builder().withAuthProvider][SessionBuilder.withAuthProvider].

Cassandra's binary protocol supports [SASL]-based authentication. To use it, you must provide an
*auth provider* that will authenticate with the server every time a new connection gets established.

This can be done in two ways: 

### In the configuration

Define an `auth-provider` section in the [configuration](../configuration/):

```
datastax-java-driver {
  advanced.auth-provider {
    class = PlainTextAuthProvider
    username = cassandra
    password = cassandra
  }
}
```

Authentication must be configured before opening a session, it cannot be changed at runtime.

`PlainTextAuthProvider` is provided out of the box, for simple username/password authentication
(intended to work with the server-side `PasswordAuthenticator`). The credentials can be changed at
runtime, they will be used for new connection attempts once the configuration gets reloaded. 

You can also write your own provider; it must implement [AuthProvider] and declare a public
constructor with a [DriverContext] argument.

```
datastax-java-driver {
  advanced.auth-provider {
    class = com.mycompany.MyCustomAuthProvider
    ... // any custom options your provider might use
  }
}
```

### Programmatically

You can also pass an authenticator instance while building the session:

```java
CqlSession session =
    CqlSession.builder()
        .withAuthProvider(new MyCustomAuthProvider())
        .build();
```

For convenience, there is a shortcut that takes the credentials directly. This is equivalent to
using `PlainTextAuthProvider` in the configuration:

```java
CqlSession session =
    CqlSession.builder()
        .withAuthCredentials("user", "pass")
        .build();
```

One downside of `withAuthCredentials` is that the credentials are stored in clear text in memory;
this means they are vulnerable to an attacker who is able to perform memory dumps. If this is not
acceptable for you, consider writing your own [AuthProvider] implementation
([PlainTextAuthProviderBase] is a good starting point).
