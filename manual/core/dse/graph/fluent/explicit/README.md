## Explicit execution

Fluent traversals can be wrapped into a [FluentGraphStatement] and passed to the session:

```java
// A "dummy", non-connected traversal source that is not meant to be iterated directly, but instead
// serves as the basis to build fluent statements:
import static com.datastax.dse.driver.api.core.graph.DseGraph.g;

GraphTraversal<Vertex, Vertex> traversal = g.V().has("name", "marko");
FluentGraphStatement statement = FluentGraphStatement.newInstance(traversal);

GraphResultSet result = session.execute(statement);
for (GraphNode node : result) {
  System.out.println(node.asVertex());
}
```

### Creating fluent statements

#### Factory method

As shown above, [FluentGraphStatement.newInstance] creates a statement from a traversal directly.

The default implementation returned by the driver is **immutable**; if you call additional methods
on the statement -- for example to set [options](../../options/) -- each method call will create a
new copy:

```java
FluentGraphStatement statement = FluentGraphStatement.newInstance(traversal);
FluentGraphStatement statement2 = statement.setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10));

assert statement2 != statement;
``` 

Immutability is good because it makes statements inherently **thread-safe**: you can share them in
your application and access them concurrently without any risk.

On the other hand, it means a lot of intermediary copies if you often call methods on your
statements. Modern VMs are normally good at dealing with such short-lived objects, but if you're
worried about the performance impact, consider using a builder instead.

Note: contrary to driver statements, Tinkerpop's `GraphTraversal` is mutable and therefore not
thread-safe. This is fine if you just wrap a traversal into a statement and never modify it
afterwards, but be careful not to share traversals and modify them concurrently.

#### Builder

Instead of creating a statement directly, you can pass your traversal to
[FluentGraphStatement.builder], chain method calls to set options, and finally call `build()`:

```java
FluentGraphStatement statement1 =
    FluentGraphStatement.builder(traversal)
        .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .withIdempotence(true)
        .build();
```

The builder implementation is **mutable**: every method call returns the same object, only one
builder instance will be created no matter how many methods you call on it. As a consequence, the
builder object is **not thread-safe**.

You can also initialize a builder from an existing statement: it will inherit all of its options.

```java
FluentGraphStatement statement2 =
    FluentGraphStatement.builder(statement1).withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20)).build();

assert statement2.getTraversal().equals(statement1.getTraversal());
assert statement2.getTimeout().equals(Duration.ofSeconds(20)); // overridden by the builder
assert statement2.isIdempotent(); // because statement1 was
```

### Batching traversals

[BatchGraphStatement] allows you to execute multiple mutating traversals in the same transaction.
Like other types of statements, it is immutable and thread-safe, and can be created either with a
[factory method][BatchGraphStatement.newInstance] or a [builder][BatchGraphStatement.builder]: 

```java
GraphTraversal<Vertex, Vertex> traversal1 = g.addV("person").property("name", "batch1").property("age", 1);
GraphTraversal<Vertex, Vertex> traversal2 = g.addV("person").property("name", "batch2").property("age", 2);

// Each method call creates a copy:
BatchGraphStatement batch1 = BatchGraphStatement.newInstance()
    .addTraversal(traversal1)
    .addTraversal(traversal2);

// Uses a single, mutable builder instance:
BatchGraphStatement batch2 = BatchGraphStatement.builder()
        .addTraversal(traversal1)
        .addTraversal(traversal2)
        .build();
```

Traversal batches are only available with DSE 6.0 or above.

### Prepared statements

At the time of writing (DSE 6.0), prepared graph statements are not supported yet; they will be
added in a future version.
