== Query idempotence

=== Quick overview

A request is _idempotent_ if executing it multiple times leaves the database in the same state as executing it only once.

* `basic.request.default-idempotence` in the configuration (defaults to false).
* can be overridden per statement https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/Statement.html#setIdempotent-java.lang.Boolean-[Statement.setIdempotent] or https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/StatementBuilder.html#setIdempotence-java.lang.Boolean-[StatementBuilder.setIdempotence].
* retries and speculative executions only happen for idempotent statements.

'''

For example:

* `update my_table set list_col = [1] where pk = 1` is idempotent: no matter how many times it gets executed, `list_col`  will always end up with the value `[1]`;
* `update my_table set list_col = [1] + list_col where pk = 1` is not idempotent: if `list_col` was initially empty, it will contain `[1]` after the first execution, `[1, 1]` after the second, etc.

Idempotence matters because the driver sometimes re-runs requests automatically:

* link:../retries[retries]: if we're waiting for a response from a node and the connection gets dropped, the default retry policy automatically retries on another node.
But we can't know what went wrong with the first node: maybe it went down, or maybe it was just a network issue;
in any case, it might have applied the changes already.
Therefore non-idempotent requests are never retried.
* link:../speculative_execution[speculative executions]: if they are enabled and a node takes too long to respond, the driver queries another node to get the response faster.
But maybe both nodes will eventually apply the changes.
Therefore non-idempotent requests are never speculatively executed.

In most cases, you need to flag your statements manually:

[source,java]
----
SimpleStatement statement =
    SimpleStatement.newInstance("SELECT first_name FROM user WHERE id=1")
        .setIdempotent(true);

// Or with a builder:
SimpleStatement statement =
    SimpleStatement.builder("SELECT first_name FROM user WHERE id=1")
        .setIdempotence(true)
        .build();
----

If you don't, they default to the value defined in the link:../configuration/[configuration] by the `basic.request.default-idempotence` option;
out of the box, it is set to `false`.

When you prepare a statement, its idempotence carries over to bound statements:

[source,java]
----
PreparedStatement pst = session.prepare(
    SimpleStatement.newInstance("SELECT first_name FROM user WHERE id=?")
        .setIdempotent(true));
BoundStatement bs = pst.bind(1);
assert bs.isIdempotent();
----

The query builder tries to infer idempotence automatically;
refer to link:../../query_builder/idempotence/[its manual] for more details.
