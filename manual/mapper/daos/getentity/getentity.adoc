== GetEntity methods

Annotate a DAO method with https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/mapper/annotations/GetEntity.html[@GetEntity] to convert a core driver data structure into one or more link:../../entities[Entities]:

[source,java]
----
@Dao
public interface ProductDao {
  @GetEntity
  Product asProduct(Row row);
}
----

The generated code will retrieve each entity property from the source, such as:

[source,java]
----
Product product = new Product();
product.setId(row.get("id", UUID.class));
product.setDescription(row.get("description", String.class));
...
----

It does not perform a query.
Instead, those methods are intended for cases where you already have a query result, and just need the conversion logic.

=== Lenient mode

By default, the mapper operates in "strict" mode: the source row must contain a matching column for every property in the entity definition, _including computed ones_.
If such a column is not found, an error will be thrown.

Starting with driver 4.12.0, the `@GetEntity` annotation has a new `lenient` attribute.
If this attribute is explicitly set to `true`, the mapper will operate in "lenient" mode: all entity properties that have a matching column in the source row will be set.
However, _unmatched properties will be left untouched_.

As an example to illustrate how lenient mode works, assume that we have the following entity and DAO:

[source,java]
----
@Entity class Product {

  @PartitionKey int id;
  String description;
  float price;
  // other members omitted
}

interface ProductDao {

  @GetEntity(lenient = true)
  Product getLenient(Row row);

}
----

Then the following code would be possible:

[source,java]
----
// row does not contain the price column
Row row = session.execute("SELECT id, description FROM product").one();
Product product = productDao.getLenient(row);
assert product.price == 0.0;
----

Since no `price` column was found in the source row, `product.price` wasn't set and was left to its default value (0.0).
Without lenient mode, the code above would throw an error instead.

Lenient mode allows to achieve the equivalent of driver 3.x https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.10/manual/object_mapper/using/#manual-mapping[manual mapping feature].

*Beware that lenient mode may result in incomplete entities being produced.*

=== Parameters

The method must have a single parameter.
The following types are allowed:

* https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/data/GettableByName.html[GettableByName] or one of its subtypes (the most likely candidates are https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/Row.html[Row] and https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/data/UdtValue.html[UdtValue]).
* https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/ResultSet.html[ResultSet].
* https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/AsyncResultSet.html[AsyncResultSet].

The data must match the target entity: the generated code will try to extract every mapped property, and fail if one is missing.

=== Return type

The method can return:

* a single entity instance.
If the argument is a result set type, the generated code will extract the first row and convert it, or return `null` if the result set is empty.
+
[,`java]
----
  @GetEntity
  Product asProduct(Row row);

  @GetEntity
  Product firstRowAsProduct(ResultSet resultSet);
----

* a https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/PagingIterable.html[PagingIterable] of an entity class.
In that case, the type of the parameter *must* be https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/ResultSet.html[ResultSet].
Each row in the result set will be converted into an entity instance.
+
[source,java]
----
  @GetEntity
  PagingIterable<Product> asProducts(ResultSet resultSet);
----

* a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html[Stream] of an entity class.
In that case, the type of the parameter *must* be https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/ResultSet.html[ResultSet].
Each row in the result set will be converted into an entity instance.
+
NOTE: even if streams are lazily evaluated, results are fetched synchronously;
therefore, as the   returned stream is traversed, blocking calls may occur, as more results are fetched from the   server in the background.
For details about the stream's characteristics, see   https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/PagingIterable.html#spliterator--[PagingIterable.spliterator].
+
[source,java]
----
  @GetEntity
  Stream<Product> asProducts(ResultSet resultSet);
----

* a https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/MappedAsyncPagingIterable.html[MappedAsyncPagingIterable] of an entity class.
In that case, the type of the parameter *must* be https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/AsyncResultSet.html[AsyncResultSet].
Each row in the result set will be converted into an entity instance.
+
[source,java]
----
  @GetEntity
  MappedAsyncPagingIterable<Product> asProducts(AsyncResultSet resultSet);
----

If the return type doesn't match the parameter type (for example https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/PagingIterable.html[PagingIterable] for https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/4.14/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/cql/AsyncResultSet.html[AsyncResultSet]), the mapper processor will issue a compile-time error.
