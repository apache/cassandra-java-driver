== Connecting to Astra (Cloud)

Using the DataStax Java Driver to connect to a DataStax Astra database is almost identical to using the driver to connect to any normal Apache CassandraÂ® database.
The only differences are in how the driver is configured in an application and that you will need to obtain a _secure connect bundle_.

=== Prerequisites

. https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Download] and https://maven.apache.org/install.html[install] Maven.
. Create an Astra database on https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html[AWS/Azure/GCP];
alternatively, have a team member provide access to their Astra database (instructions for https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/obtaining-database-credentials.html#_sharing_your_secure_connect_bundle[AWS/Azure/GCP] to obtain database connection details.
. Download the secure connect bundle (instructions for  https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/obtaining-database-credentials.html[AWS/Azure/GCP], that contains connection information such as contact points and certificates.

=== Procedure

Create a minimal project structure as explained link:../core/integration/#minimal-project-structure[here].
Then modify `Main.java` using one of the following approaches:

==== Programmatic configuration

You can pass the connection information directly to `CqlSession.builder()`:

[source,java]
----
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.ResultSet;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.Row;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (CqlSession session = CqlSession.builder()
            // make sure you change the path to the secure connect bundle below
            .withCloudSecureConnectBundle(Paths.get("/path/to/secure-connect-database_name.zip"))
            .withAuthCredentials("user_name","password")
            .withKeyspace("keyspace_name")
            .build()) {

                // For the sake of example, run a simple query and print the results
                ResultSet rs = session.execute("select release_version from system.local");
                Row row = rs.one();
                if (row != null) {
                    System.out.println(row.getString("release_version"));
                } else {
                    System.out.println("An error occurred.");
                }
           }
        }
    }
----

The path to the secure connect bundle for your Astra database is specified with `withCloudSecureConnectBundle()`.
The authentication credentials must be specified separately with `withAuthCredentials()`, and match the username and password that were configured when creating the Astra database.

Note the following:

* an SSL connection will be established automatically.
Manual SSL configuration is not allowed, any settings in the driver configuration (`advanced.ssl-engine-factory`) will be ignored;
* the secure connect bundle contains all of the necessary contact information.
Specifying contact points manually is not allowed, and will result in an error;
* if the driver configuration does not specify an explicit consistency level, it will default to `LOCAL_QUORUM` (instead of `LOCAL_ONE` when connecting to a normal Cassandra database).

==== File-based configuration

Alternatively, the connection information can be specified in the driver's configuration file (`application.conf`).
Merge the following options with any content already present:

[,properties]
----
datastax-java-driver {
  basic {
    # change this to match the target keyspace
    session-keyspace = keyspace_name
    cloud {
      # change this to match bundle's location; can be either a path on the local filesystem
      # or a valid URL, e.g. http://acme.com/path/to/secure-connect-database_name.zip
      secure-connect-bundle = /path/to/secure-connect-database_name.zip
    }
  }
  advanced {
    auth-provider {
      class = PlainTextAuthProvider
      # change below to match the appropriate credentials
      username = user_name
      password = password
    }
  }
}
----

For more information about the driver configuration mechanism, refer to the link:../core/configuration/[driver documentation].

With the above configuration, your main Java class can be simplified as shown below:

[source,java]
----
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.ResultSet;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.Row;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create the CqlSession object; it will read the configuration file and pick the right
    // values to connect to the Astra database.
    try (CqlSession session = CqlSession.builder().build()) {

      ResultSet rs = session.execute("select release_version from system.local");
      Row row = rs.one();
      if (row != null) {
        System.out.println(row.getString("release_version"));
      } else {
        System.out.println("An error occurred.");
      }
    }
  }
}
