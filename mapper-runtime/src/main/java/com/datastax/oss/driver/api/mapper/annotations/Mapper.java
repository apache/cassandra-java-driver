/**
 * Annotates an interface that will serve as the entry point to mapper features.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Mapper
 * public interface InventoryMapper {
 *   &#64;DaoFactory
 *   ProductDao productDao();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The mapper annotation processor will generate an implementation, and a builder that allows you to
 * create an instance from a {@link Session}:
 *
 * <pre>
 * InventoryMapper inventoryMapper = new InventoryMapperBuilder(session).build();
 * </pre>
 *
 * By default, the builder's name is the name of the interface with the suffix "Builder", and it
 * resides in the same package. You can also use a custom name with {@link #builderName()}.
 *
 * <p>The interface should define one or more {@link DaoFactory} methods.
