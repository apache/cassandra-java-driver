/**
 * Annotates an {@link Entity} to indicate which properties should be considered 'transient',
 * meaning that they should not be mapped to any column (neither during reads nor writes).
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;TransientProperties({"notAColumn", "x"})
 * &#64;Entity
 * public class Product {
 *   &#64;PartitionKey private UUID id;
 *   private String description;
 *   // these columns are not included because their names are specified in &#64;TransientProperties
 *   private int notAColumn;
 *   private int x;
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This annotation is an alternative to using the {@link Transient} annotation on a field or
 * getter. It is useful in cases where this annotation may be specified on a parent class where
 * implementing classes will share a common configuration without needing to explicitly annotate
 * each property with a {@link Transient} annotation.
