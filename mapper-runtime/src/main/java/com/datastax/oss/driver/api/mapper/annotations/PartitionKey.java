/**
 * Annotates the field or getter of an {@link Entity} property, to indicate that it's part of the
 * partition key.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;PartitionKey private UUID id;
 * </pre>
 *
 * This information is used by the mapper processor to generate default queries (for example a basic
 * {@link Select}). Note that an entity is not required to have a partition key, for example if it
 * only gets mapped as a UDT.
 *
 * <p>If the partition key is composite, you must specify {@link #value()} to indicate the position
 * of each property:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;PartitionKey(1) private int pk1;
 * &#64;PartitionKey(2) private int pk2;
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you don't specify positions, or if there are duplicates, the mapper processor will issue a
 * compile-time error.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is mutually exclusive with {@link ClusteringColumn}.
