# Unless you use a custom mechanism to load your configuration (see DriverContext), all the values
# declared here will be used as defaults if you don't override them in your own `application.conf`.

datastax-java-driver {
  # The contact points to use for the initial connection to the cluster.
  #
  # These are addresses of Cassandra nodes that the driver uses to discover the cluster topology.
  # Only one contact point is required (the driver will retrieve the address of the other nodes
  # automatically), but it is usually a good idea to provide more than one contact point, because
  # if that single contact point is unavailable, the driver cannot initialize itself correctly.
  #
  # This must be a list of strings with each contact point specified as "host:port". If the host is
  # a DNS name that resolves to multiple A-records, all the corresponding addresses will be used.
  # Do not use "localhost" as the host name (since it resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on
  # some platforms).
  #
  # Note that the current version of Cassandra (3.11) requires all nodes in a cluster to share the
  # same port.
  #
  # This option is not required. Contact points can also be provided programmatically when you build
  # a cluster instance. If both are specified, they will be merged.
  // contact-points = [ "127.0.0.1:9042", "127.0.0.2:9042" ]

  protocol {
    # The native protocol version to use.
    #
    # This option is not required. If it is absent, the driver looks up the versions of the nodes at
    # startup (by default in system.peers.release_version), and chooses the highest common protocol
    # version. For  example, if you have a mixed cluster with Apache Cassandra 2.1 nodes (protocol
    # v3) and Apache Cassandra 3.0 nodes (protocol v3 and v4), then protocol v3 is chosen. If the
    # nodes don't have a common protocol version, initialization fails.
    #
    # If this option is set, then the given version will be used for all connections, without any
    # negotiation or downgrading. If any of the contact points doesn't support it, it will be
    # skipped.
    #
    # Once the protocol version is set, it can't change for the rest of the driver's lifetime; if an
    # incompatible node joins the cluster later, connection will fail and the driver will force it
    # down (i.e. never try to connect to it again).
