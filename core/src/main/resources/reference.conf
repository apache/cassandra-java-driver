# Reference configuration for the DataStax Java driver for Apache CassandraÂ®.

# Unless you use a custom mechanism to load your configuration (see DriverContext), all the values
# declared here will be used as defaults if you don't override them in your own `application.conf`.

# Unless explicitly stated otherwise:
# - options are required;

# - runtime changes are ignored.

datastax-java-driver {
  # The contact points to use for the initial connection to the cluster.
  #
  # These are addresses of Cassandra nodes that the driver uses to discover the cluster topology.
  # Only one contact point is required (the driver will retrieve the address of the other nodes
  # automatically), but it is usually a good idea to provide more than one contact point, because
  # if that single contact point is unavailable, the driver cannot initialize itself correctly.
  #
  # This must be a list of strings with each contact point specified as "host:port". If the host is
  # a DNS name that resolves to multiple A-records, all the corresponding addresses will be used.
  # Do not use "localhost" as the host name (since it resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on
  # some platforms).
  #
  # Note that the current version of Cassandra (3.11) requires all nodes in a cluster to share the
  # same port.
  #
  # This option is not required. Contact points can also be provided programmatically when you build
  # a cluster instance. If both are specified, they will be merged. If both are absent, the driver
  # will default to 127.0.0.1:9042.
  // contact-points = [ "127.0.0.1:9042", "127.0.0.2:9042" ]

  protocol {
    # The native protocol version to use.
    #
    # This option is not required. If it is absent, the driver looks up the versions of the nodes at
    # startup (by default in system.peers.release_version), and chooses the highest common protocol
    # version. For  example, if you have a mixed cluster with Apache Cassandra 2.1 nodes (protocol
    # v3) and Apache Cassandra 3.0 nodes (protocol v3 and v4), then protocol v3 is chosen. If the
    # nodes don't have a common protocol version, initialization fails.
    #
    # If this option is set, then the given version will be used for all connections, without any
    # negotiation or downgrading. If any of the contact points doesn't support it, it will be
    # skipped.
    #
    # Once the protocol version is set, it can't change for the rest of the driver's lifetime; if an
    # incompatible node joins the cluster later, connection will fail and the driver will force it
    # down (i.e. never try to connect to it again).
    #
    # You can check the actual version at runtime with Cluster.getContext().protocolVersion().
    // version = V4

    # The maximum length of the frames supported by the driver. Beyond that limit, requests will
    # fail with an exception
    #
    # This option can be changed at runtime, the new value will be used for new connections created
    # after the change.

      # package com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.auth.

      # The driver provides a single implementation out of the box: PlainTextAuthProvider, that uses
      # plain-text credentials. It requires the `username` and `password` options below.
      #
      # You can also specify a custom class that implements AuthProvider and has a public
      # constructor with a DriverContext argument.
      #
      # This property is optional; if it is not present, no authentication will occur.
      // class = PlainTextAuthProvider

      # Sample configuration for the plain-text provider:
      // username = cassandra
      // password = cassandra
    }

    # The compressor to use for protocol frames. If it is not qualified, the driver assumes that it
    # resides in the package com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.protocol.
    #
    # The driver provides two built-in implementations for the algorithms supported by Cassandra:
    # - Lz4Compressor: requires org.xerial.snappy:snappy-java in the classpath.
    # - SnappyCompressor: requires net.jpountz.lz4:lz4 in the classpath.
    #
    # The driver depends on the compression libraries, but they are optional. Make sure you
    # redeclare an explicit dependency in your project. Refer to the driver's POM or manual for the
    # exact version.
    #
    # If this property is absent, protocol frames are not compressed.
    // compressor.class =

  # A name that uniquely identifies the driver instance created from this configuration. This is
  # used as a prefix for log messages and metrics.
  # This option is not required; if it is not specified, the driver will generate an identifier
  # composed of the letter 's' followed by an incrementing counter.
  # If you provide a different value, try to keep it short to keep the logs readable. Also, make
  # sure it is unique: reusing the same value will not break the driver, but it will mix up the logs
  # and metrics.
  // session-name = my_session

  # The name of the keyspace that the session should initially be connected to.
  #
  # This expects the same format as in a CQL query: case-sensitive names must be quoted (note that
  # the quotes must be escaped in HOCON format). For example:
  #    session-keyspace = case_insensitive_name
  #    session-keyspace = \"CaseSensitiveName\"
  #
  # This option is not required; if it is left unspecified, the session won't be connected to any
  # keyspace, and you'll have to either qualify table names in your queries, or use the per-query
  # keyspace feature available in Cassandra 4 and above (see Request.getKeyspace()).
  #
  # This can also be provided programatically in CqlSessionBuilder.
  // session-keyspace = my_keyspace

    # defaults to 127.0.0.1:9042, and that node's datacenter is used as the local datacenter.
    #
    # As soon as you provide contact points (either through the configuration or through the cluster
    # builder), you must define the local datacenter explicitly, and initialization will fail if
    # this property is absent. In addition, all contact points should be from this datacenter;
    # warnings will be logged for nodes that are from a different one.
    // local-datacenter = datacenter1

    #
    # Alternatively, you can pass an instance of your filter to

    # threshold. Pending requests may be enqueued and retried later.

    # From the public API's point of view, this process is mostly transparent: any time that the
    # request is throttled is included in the session.execute() or session.executeAsync() call.
    # Similarly, the request timeout encompasses throttling: the timeout starts ticking before the
    # throttler has started processing the request; a request may time out while it is still in the
    # throttler's queue, before the driver has even tried to send it to a node.
    #
    # The only visible effect is that a request may fail with a RequestThrottlingException, if the
