/**
 * A session that has the ability to execute continuous paging queries.
 *
 * <p>Continuous paging is a new method of streaming bulk amounts of records from DataStax
 * Enterprise (DSE) to the DataStax Java Driver, available since DSE 5.1. It is mainly intended to
 * be leveraged by <a
 * href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-dev/datastax_enterprise/analytics/analyticsTOC.html">DSE
 * Analytics</a> and Apache Sparkâ„¢, or by any similar analytics tool that needs to read large
 * portions of a table in one single operation, as quick and reliably as possible.
 *
 * <p>Continuous paging provides the best performance improvement against regular paging when the
 * following conditions are met:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The statement must target a single partition or a token range owned by one single replica;
 *       in practice, this means that the statement must have either a {@linkplain
 *       Statement#setRoutingKey(ByteBuffer) routing key} or a {@linkplain
 *       Statement#setRoutingToken(Token) routing token} set;
 *   <li>The coordinator must be a replica; in practice, this is usually achieved by using
 *       token-aware routing (if you are using the driver's default {@link LoadBalancingPolicy},
 *       then this condition is met);
 *   <li>The consistency level must be {@link DefaultConsistencyLevel#ONE ONE} (or {@link
 *       DefaultConsistencyLevel#LOCAL_ONE LOCAL_ONE}).
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>If the above conditions are met, the coordinator will be able to optimize the read path and
 * serve results from local data, thus significantly improving response times; if however these
 * conditions cannot be met, continuous paging would still work, but response times wouldn't be
 * significantly better than those of regular paging anymore.
