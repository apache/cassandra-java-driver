/**
 * A {@link Publisher} of {@link ReactiveGraphNode}s returned by a {@link ReactiveGraphSession}.
 *
 * <p>By default, all implementations returned by the driver are cold, unicast, single-subscriber
 * only publishers. In other words, <em>they do not support multiple subscriptions</em>; consider
 * caching the results produced by such publishers if you need to consume them by more than one
 * downstream subscriber.
 *
 * <p>Also, note that reactive graph result sets may emit items to their subscribers on an internal
 * driver IO thread. Subscriber implementors are encouraged to abide by <a
 * href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#2.2">Reactive Streams
 * Specification rule 2.2</a> and avoid performing heavy computations or blocking calls inside
 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber#onNext(Object) onNext} calls, as doing so could slow down
 * the driver and impact performance. Instead, they should asynchronously dispatch received signals
 * to their processing logic.
 *
 * <p>This interface exists mainly to expose useful information about {@linkplain
 * #getExecutionInfos() request execution}. This is particularly convenient for queries that do not
 * return rows; for queries that do return rows, it is also possible, and oftentimes easier, to
 * access that same information {@linkplain ReactiveGraphNode at node level}.
