   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@link FluentGraphStatement} (recommended): wraps a fluent TinkerPop {@linkplain
   *       org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.dsl.graph.GraphTraversal traversal};
   *   <li>{@link BatchGraphStatement}: groups together multiple mutating traversals ({@code
   *       g.addV()/g.addE()}) inside a single transaction and avoids multiple client-server
   *       round-trips. Improves performance in data ingestion scenarios;
   *   <li>{@link ScriptGraphStatement}: wraps a Gremlin-groovy script provided as a plain Java
   *       string. Required for administrative queries such as creating/dropping a graph,
   *       configuration and schema.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This feature is only available with DataStax Enterprise. Executing graph queries against an
   * Apache Cassandra&reg; cluster will result in a runtime error.
   *
   * @see GraphResultSet
   * @param graphStatement the graph query to execute (that can be any {@code GraphStatement}).
   * @return the result of the graph query. That result will never be null but can be empty.
