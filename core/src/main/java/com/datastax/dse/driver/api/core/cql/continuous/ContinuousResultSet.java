 * <p>It uses {@linkplain ContinuousAsyncResultSet asynchronous calls} internally, but blocks on the
 * results in order to provide a synchronous API to its clients. If the query is paged, only the
 * first page will be fetched initially, and iteration will trigger background fetches of the next
 * pages when necessary.
 *
 * <p>Note that this object can only be iterated once: rows are "consumed" as they are read,
 * subsequent calls to {@code iterator()} will return the same iterator instance.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this type are <b>not</b> thread-safe. They can only be iterated by the
 * thread that invoked {@code session.executeContinuously}.

   *       statement;
   *   <li>Resume the operation by invoking {@link ContinuousSession#executeContinuously(Statement)
