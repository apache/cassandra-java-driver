/**
 * A {@link Session} that offers utility methods to issue queries using reactive-style programming
 * and continuous paging, combined together.
 *
 * <p>Methods in this interface all return {@link ContinuousReactiveResultSet} instances. All
 * publishers support multiple subscriptions in a unicast fashion: each subscriber triggers an
 * independent request execution and gets its own copy of the results.
 *
 * <p>Also, note that the publishers may emit items to their subscribers on an internal driver IO
 * thread. Subscriber implementors are encouraged to abide by <a
 * href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#2.2">Reactive Streams
 * Specification rule 2.2</a> and avoid performing heavy computations or blocking calls inside
 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber#onNext(Object) onNext} calls, as doing so could slow down
 * the driver and impact performance. Instead, they should asynchronously dispatch received signals
 * to their processing logic.
