/**
 * Thrown when the connection on which a request was executing is closed due to an unrelated event.
 *
 * <p>For example, this can happen if the node is unresponsive and a heartbeat query failed, or if
 * the node was forced down.
 *
 * <p>The driver will retry these requests on the next node transparently, unless the request is not
 * idempotent. Therefore, this exception is usually observed as part of an {@link
 * AllNodesFailedException}.
