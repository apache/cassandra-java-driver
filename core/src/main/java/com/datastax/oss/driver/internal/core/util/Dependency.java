/**
 * A set of driver optional dependencies and a common mechanism to test the presence of such
 * dependencies on the application's classpath.
 *
 * <p>We use the given fully-qualified names of classes to test the presence of the whole dependency
 * on the classpath, including its transitive dependencies if applicable. This assumes that if these
 * classes are present, then the entire library is present and functional, and vice versa.
 *
 * <p>Note: some of the libraries declared here may be shaded; in these cases the shade plugin will
 * replace the package names listed above with names starting with {@code
 * com.datastax.oss.driver.shaded.*}, but the presence check would still work as expected.
