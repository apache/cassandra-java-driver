/**
 * The default session type built by the driver.
 *
 * <p>It provides user-friendly execution methods for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>CQL requests: synchronous, asynchronous or reactive mode;
 *   <li>requests specific to DataStax Enterprise: graph and continuous paging.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Client applications can use this interface even if they don't need all the features. In
 * particular, it can be used with a regular Apache Cassandra &reg; cluster, as long as you don't
 * call any of the DSE-specific execute methods. If you're in that situation, you might also want to
 * exclude certain dependencies from your classpath (see the "Integration" page in the user manual).
 *
 * <p>Note that the name "CQL session" is no longer really accurate since this interface can now
 * execute other request types; but it was preserved for backward compatibility with previous driver
 * versions.
