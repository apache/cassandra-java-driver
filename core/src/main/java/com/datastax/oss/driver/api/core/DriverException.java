/**
 * Base class for all exceptions thrown by the driver.
 *
 * <p>Note that, for obvious programming errors, the driver might throw JDK runtime exceptions, such
 * as {@link IllegalArgumentException} or {@link IllegalStateException}. In all other cases, it will
 * be an instance of this class.
 *
 * <p>One special case is when the driver tried multiple nodes to complete a request, and they all
 * failed; the error returned to the client will be an {@link AllNodesFailedException}, which wraps
 * a map of errors per node.
 *
 * <p>Some implementations make the stack trace not writable to improve performance (see {@link
 * Throwable#Throwable(String, Throwable, boolean, boolean)}). This is only done when the exception
 * is thrown in a small number of well-known cases, and the stack trace wouldn't add any useful
 * information (for example, server error responses). Instances returned by {@link #copy()} always
 * have a stack trace.
