 * <p>It uses asynchronous calls internally, but blocks on the results in order to provide a
 * synchronous API to its clients. If the query is paged, only the first page will be fetched
 * initially, and iteration will trigger background fetches of the next pages when necessary.
 *
 * <p>Note that this object can only be iterated once: elements are "consumed" as they are read,
 * subsequent calls to {@code iterator()} will return the same iterator instance.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this type are <b>not thread-safe</b>. They can only be iterated by the
 * thread that invoked {@code session.execute}.
 *
 * <p>This is a generalization of {@link ResultSet}, replacing rows by an arbitrary element type.
