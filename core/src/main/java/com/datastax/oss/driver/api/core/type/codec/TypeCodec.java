/**
 * Manages the two-way conversion between a CQL type and a Java type.
 *
 * <p>Type codec implementations:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><em>must</em> be thread-safe.
 *   <li><em>must</em> perform fast and never block.
 *   <li><em>must</em> support all native protocol versions; it is not possible to use different
 *       codecs for the same types but under different protocol versions.
 *   <li><em>must</em> comply with the native protocol specifications; failing to do so will result
 *       in unexpected results and could cause the driver to crash.
 *   <li><em>should</em> be stateless and immutable.
 *   <li><em>should</em> interpret {@code null} values and empty byte buffers (i.e. <code>
 *       {@link ByteBuffer#remaining()} == 0</code>) in a <em>reasonable</em> way; usually, {@code
 *       NULL} CQL values should map to {@code null} references, but exceptions exist; e.g. for
 *       varchar types, a {@code NULL} CQL value maps to a {@code null} reference, whereas an empty
 *       buffer maps to an empty String. For collection types, it is also admitted that {@code NULL}
 *       CQL values map to empty Java collections instead of {@code null} references. In any case,
 *       the codec's behavior with respect to {@code null} values and empty ByteBuffers should be
 *       clearly documented.
 *   <li>for Java types that have a primitive equivalent, <em>should</em> implement the appropriate
 *       "primitive" codec interface, e.g. {@link PrimitiveBooleanCodec} for {@code boolean}. This
 *       allows the driver to avoid the overhead of boxing when using primitive accessors such as
 *       {@link Row#getBoolean(int)}.
 *   <li>when decoding, <em>must</em> not consume {@link ByteBuffer} instances by performing
 *       relative read operations that modify their current position; codecs should instead prefer
 *       absolute read methods or, if necessary, {@link ByteBuffer#duplicate() duplicate} their byte
 *       buffers prior to reading them.
 * </ol>
