/**
 * Translates IP addresses received from Cassandra nodes into locally queriable
 * addresses.
 * <p>
 * The driver auto-detect new Cassandra nodes added to the cluster through server
 * side pushed notifications and through checking the system tables. For each
 * node, the address the driver will receive will correspond to the address set as
 * {@code rpc_address} in the node yaml file. In most case, this is the correct
 * address to use by the driver and that is what is used by default. However,
 * sometimes the addresses received through this mechanism will either not be
 * reachable directly by the driver or should not be the prefered address to use
 * to reach the node (for instance, the {@code rpc_address} set on Cassandra nodes
 * might be a private IP, but some clients  may have to use a public IP, or
 * pass by a router to reach that node). This interface allows to deal with
 * such cases, by allowing to translate an address as sent by a Cassandra node
 * to another address to be used by the driver for connection.
 * <p>
 * Please note that the contact points addresses provided while creating the
 * {@link Cluster} instance are not "tanslated", only IP address retrieve from or sent
 * by Cassandra nodes to the driver are.
