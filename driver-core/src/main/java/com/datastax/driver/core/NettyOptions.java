/**
 * A set of hooks that allow clients to customize the driver's underlying Netty layer.
 * <p/>
 * Clients that need to hook into the driver's underlying Netty layer can
 * subclass this class and provide the necessary customization by overriding
 * its methods.
 * <p/>
 * Typically, clients would register this class with {@link Cluster#builder()}:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     NettyOptions nettyOptions = ...
 *     Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder()
 *          .addContactPoint(...)
 *          .withNettyOptions(nettyOptions)
 *          .build();
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Extending the NettyOptions API</strong>
 * <p/>
 * Contrary to other driver options, the options available in this class should
 * be considered as advanced features and as such, <em>they should only be
 * modified by expert users</em>.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>A misconfiguration introduced by the means of this API can have unexpected results
 * and cause the driver to completely fail to connect.</strong>
 * <p/>
 * Moreover, since versions 2.0.9 and 2.1.4 (see JAVA-538),
 * the driver is available in two different flavors: with a standard Maven dependency on Netty,
 * or with a "shaded" (internalized) Netty dependency.
 * <p/>
 * Given that NettyOptions API exposes Netty classes ({@link SocketChannel}, etc.),
 * <em>it should only be extended by clients using the non-shaded
 * version of driver</em>.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Extending this API with shaded Netty classes is not supported,
 * and in particular for OSGi applications, it is likely that such a configuration would lead to
 * compile and/or runtime errors.</strong>
 *
 * @since 2.0.10
