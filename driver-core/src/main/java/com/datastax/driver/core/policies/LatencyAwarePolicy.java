/**
 * A wrapper load balancing policy that adds latency awareness to a child policy.
 * <p/>
 * When used, this policy will collect the latencies of the queries to each
 * Cassandra node and maintain a per-node average latency score. The nodes
 * that are slower than the best performing node by more than a configurable threshold
 * will be moved to the end of the query plan (that is, they will only be tried if
 * all other nodes failed). Note that this policy only penalizes slow nodes, it does
 * <em>not</em> globally sort the query plan by latency.
 * <p/>
 * The latency score for a given node is a based on a form of
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average">exponential moving average</a>.
 * In other words, the latency score of a node is the average of its previously
 * measured latencies, but where older measurements gets an exponentially decreasing
 * weight. The exact weight applied to a newly received latency is based on the
 * time elapsed since the previous measure (to account for the fact that
 * latencies are not necessarily reported with equal regularity, neither
 * over time nor between different nodes).
 * <p/>
 * Once a node is excluded from query plans (because its averaged latency grew
 * over the exclusion threshold), its latency score will not be updated anymore
 * (since it is not queried). To give a chance to this node to recover, the
 * policy has a configurable retry period. The policy will not penalize a host
 * for which no measurement has been collected for more than this retry period.
 * <p/>
 * Please see the {@link Builder} class and methods for more details on the
 * possible parameters of this policy.
 *
 * @since 1.0.4
