/**
 * Options related to connection pooling.
 * <p>
 * The driver uses connections in an asynchronous manner. Meaning that
 * multiple requests can be submitted on the same connection at the same
 * time. This means that the driver only needs to maintain a relatively
 * small number of connections to each Cassandra host. These options allow
 * the driver to control how many connections are kept exactly.
 * <p>
 * For each host, the driver keeps a core pool of connections open at all
 * times determined by calling ({@link #getCoreConnectionsPerHost}).
 * If the use of those connections reaches a configurable threshold
 * ({@link #getMaxSimultaneousRequestsPerConnectionThreshold}),
 * more connections are created up to the configurable maximum number of
 * connections ({@link #getMaxConnectionsPerHost}). When the pool exceeds
 * the maximum number of connections, connections in excess are
 * reclaimed.
 * <p>
 * Each of these parameters can be separately set for {@code LOCAL} and
 * {@code REMOTE} hosts ({@link HostDistance}). For {@code IGNORED} hosts,
 * the default for all those settings is 0 and cannot be changed.
