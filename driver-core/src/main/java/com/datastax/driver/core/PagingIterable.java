   * Force fetching the next page of results for this result set, if any.

   * <p>This method is entirely optional. It will be called automatically while the result set is
   * consumed (through {@link #one}, {@link #all} or iteration) when needed (i.e. when {@code
   * getAvailableWithoutFetching() == 0} and {@code isFullyFetched() == false}).
   *
   * <p>You can however call this method manually to force the fetching of the next page of results.
   * This can allow to prefetch results before they are strictly needed. For instance, if you want
   * to prefetch the next page of results as soon as there is less than 100 rows readily available
   * in this result set, you can do:
   *
   * <pre>
   *   ResultSet rs = session.execute(...);
   *   Iterator&lt;Row&gt; iter = rs.iterator();
   *   while (iter.hasNext()) {
   *       if (rs.getAvailableWithoutFetching() == 100 &amp;&amp; !rs.isFullyFetched())
   *           rs.fetchMoreResults();
   *       Row row = iter.next()
   *       ... process the row ...
   *   }
   * </pre>
   *
   * This method is not blocking, so in the example above, the call to {@code fetchMoreResults} will
   * not block the processing of the 100 currently available rows (but {@code iter.hasNext()} will
   * block once those rows have been processed until the fetch query returns, if it hasn't yet).
   *
   * <p>Only one page of results (for a given result set) can be fetched at any given time. If this
   * method is called twice and the query triggered by the first call has not returned yet when the
   * second one is performed, then the 2nd call will simply return a future on the currently in
   * progress query.
   *
   * @return a future on the completion of fetching the next page of results. If the result set is
   *     already fully retrieved ({@code isFullyFetched() == true}), then the returned future will
   *     return immediately but not particular error will be thrown (you should thus call {@link
   *     #isFullyFetched()} to know if calling this method can be of any use}).
