/**
 * Indicates that a connection pool has run out of available connections.
 * <p/>
 * This happens if the pool has no connections (for example if it's currently reconnecting to its host), or if all
 * connections have reached their maximum number of in flight queries. The query will be retried on the next host in the
 * {@link com.datastax.driver.core.policies.LoadBalancingPolicy#newQueryPlan(String, Statement) query plan}.
 * <p/>
 * This exception is a symptom that the driver is experiencing a high workload. If it happens regularly on all hosts,
 * you should consider tuning one (or a combination of) the following pooling options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.datastax.driver.core.PoolingOptions#setMaxRequestsPerConnection(HostDistance, int)}: maximum number of
 * requests per connection;</li>
 * <li>{@link com.datastax.driver.core.PoolingOptions#setMaxConnectionsPerHost(HostDistance, int)}: maximum number of
 * connections in the pool;</li>
 * <li>{@link com.datastax.driver.core.PoolingOptions#setMaxQueueSize(int)}: maximum number of enqueued requests before
 * this exception is thrown.</li>
