     * Creates a new {@code SimpleStatement} with the provided query string and values.
     * <p>
     * This version of SimpleStatement is useful when you do not want to execute a
     * query only once (and thus do not want to resort to prepared statement), but
     * do not want to convert all column values to string (typically, if you have blob
     * values, encoding them to a hexadecimal string is not very efficient). In
     * that case, you can provide a query string with bind marker to this constructor
     * along with the values for those bind variables. When executed, the server will
     * prepare the provided, bind the provided values to that prepare statement and
     * execute the resulting statement. Thus,
     * <pre>
     *   session.execute(new SimpleStatement(query, value1, value2, value3));
     * </pre>
     * is functionally equivalent to
     * <pre>
     *   PreparedStatement ps = session.prepare(query);
     *   session.execute(ps.bind(value1, value2, value3));
     * </pre>
     * except that the former version:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Requires only one round-trip to a Cassandra node.</li>
     *   <li>Does not left any prepared statement stored in memory (neither client or
     *   server side) once it has been executed.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Note that the type of the {@code values} provided to this method will
     * not be validated by the driver as is done by {@link BoundStatement#bind} since
     * {@code query} is not parsed (and hence the driver cannot know what those value
     * should be). If too much or too little values are provided or if a value is not
     * a valid one for the variable it is bound to, an
     * {@link com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.InvalidQueryException} will be thrown
     * by Cassandra at execution time. An {@code IllegalArgumentException} may be
     * thrown by this constructor however if one of the value does not correspond to
     * any CQL3 type (for instance, if it is a custom class).
     *
     * @param query the query string.
     * @param values values required for the execution of {@code query}.

     * corresponding to a CQL3 type, i.e. is not a Class that could be returned
