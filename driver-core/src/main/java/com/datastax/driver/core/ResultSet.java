/**
 * The result of a query.
 * <p>
 * The retrieval of the rows of a ResultSet is generally paged (a first page
 * of result is fetched and the next one is only fetched once all the results
 * of the first one has been consumed). The size of the pages can be configured
 * either globally through {@link QueryOptions#setFetchSize} or per-statement
 * with {@link Statement#setFetchSize}. Though new pages are automatically (and
 * transparently) fetched when needed, it is possible to force the retrieval
 * of the next page early through {@link #fetchMoreResults}. Please note however
 * that this ResultSet paging is not available with the version 1 of the native
 * protocol (i.e. with Cassandra 1.2 or if version 1 has been explicitly requested
 * through {@link Cluster.Builder#withProtocolVersion}). If the protocol version 1
 * is in use, a ResultSet is always fetched in it's entirely and it's up to the
 * client to make sure that no query can yield ResultSet that won't hold in memory.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is not thread-safe.

     * <p>
     * You can however call this method manually to force the fetching of the
     * next page of results. This can allow to prefetch results before they are
     * strictly needed. For instance, if you want to prefetch the next page of

     * result set, you can do:
     * <pre>
     *   ResultSet rs = session.execute(...);

     * This method is not blocking, so in the example above, the call to {@code
     * fetchMoreResults} will not block the processing of the 100 currently available
     * rows (but {@code iter.hasNext()} will block once those rows have been processed
     * until the fetch query returns, if it hasn't yet).
     * <p>
     * Only one page of results (for a given result set) can be
     * fetched at any given time. If this method is called twice and the query
     * triggered by the first call has not returned yet when the second one is
     * performed, then the 2nd call will simply return a future on the currently
     * in progress query.
     *
     * @return a future on the completion of fetching the next page of results.
     * If the result set is already fully retrieved ({@code isFullyFetched() == true}),
     * then the returned future will return immediately but not particular error will be
     * thrown (you should thus call {@code isFullyFetched() to know if calling this
