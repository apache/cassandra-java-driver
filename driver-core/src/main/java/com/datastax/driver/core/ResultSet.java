/**
 * The result of a query.
 *
 * <p>The retrieval of the rows of a ResultSet is generally paged (a first page of result is fetched
 * and the next one is only fetched once all the results of the first one has been consumed). The
 * size of the pages can be configured either globally through {@link QueryOptions#setFetchSize} or
 * per-statement with {@link Statement#setFetchSize}. Though new pages are automatically (and
 * transparently) fetched when needed, it is possible to force the retrieval of the next page early
 * through {@link #fetchMoreResults}. Please note however that this ResultSet paging is not
 * available with the version 1 of the native protocol (i.e. with Cassandra 1.2 or if version 1 has
 * been explicitly requested through {@link Cluster.Builder#withProtocolVersion}). If the protocol
 * version 1 is in use, a ResultSet is always fetched in it's entirely and it's up to the client to
 * make sure that no query can yield ResultSet that won't hold in memory.
 *
 * <p>Note that this class is not thread-safe.

   * <p>Note that, for versions of Cassandra strictly lower than 2.0.9 and 2.1.0-rc2, a server-side
   * bug (CASSANDRA-7337) causes this method to always return {@code true} for batches containing
   * conditional queries.
