/**
 * A load balancing policy wrapper that ensure that only hosts from a provided
 * white list will ever be returned.
 * <p>
 * This policy wraps another load balancing policy and will delegate the choice
 * of hosts to the wrapped policy with the exception that only hosts contained
 * in the white list provided when constructing this policy will ever be
 * returned. Any host not in the while list will be considered {@code IGNORED}
 * and thus will not be connected to.
 * <p>
 * This policy can be useful to ensure that the driver only connects to a
 * predefined set of hosts. Keep in mind however that this policy defeats
 * somewhat the host auto-detection of the driver. As such, this policy is only
 * useful in a few special cases or for testing, but is not optimal in general.
 * If all you want to do is limiting connections to hosts of the local
 * data-center then you should use DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy and *not* this policy
 * in particular.
