/**
 * A load balancing policy wrapper that ensure that only hosts from a provided white list will ever
 * be returned.
 *
 * <p>This policy wraps another load balancing policy and will delegate the choice of hosts to the
 * wrapped policy with the exception that only hosts contained in the white list provided when
 * constructing this policy will ever be returned. Any host not in the while list will be considered
 * {@code IGNORED} and thus will not be connected to.
 *
 * <p>This policy can be useful to ensure that the driver only connects to a predefined set of
 * hosts. Keep in mind however that this policy defeats somewhat the host auto-detection of the
 * driver. As such, this policy is only useful in a few special cases or for testing, but is not
 * optimal in general. If all you want to do is limiting connections to hosts of the local
 * data-center then you should use DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy and *not* this policy in particular.
