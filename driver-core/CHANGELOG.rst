CHANGELOG
=========

* 1.0.3:
  - [api] The query builder now correctly throw an exception when given a value
    of a type it doesn't know about.
  - [new] SocketOptions#setReadTimeout allows to set a timeout on how long we
    wait for the answer of one node. See the javadoc for more details.
  - [new] New Session#prepare method that takes a Statement.
  - [bug] Always take per-query CL, tracing, etc. into account for QueryBuilder
    statements (JAVA-143).
  - [bug] Temporary fixup for TimestampType when talking to C* 2.0 nodes.


* 1.0.2:
  - [api] Host#getMonitor and all Host.HealthMonitor methods have been
    deprecated. The new Host#isUp method is now prefered to the method
    in the monitor and you should now register Host.StateListener against
    the Cluster object directly (registering against a host HealthMonitor
    was much more limited anyway).
  - [new] New serialize/deserialize methods in DataType to serialize/deserialize
    values to/from bytes (JAVA-92).
  - [new] New getIndexOf() method in ColumnDefinitions to find the index of
    a given column name (JAVA-128).
  - [bug] Fix a bug when thread could get blocked while setting the current
    keyspace (JAVA-131).
  - [bug] Quote inet addresses in the query builder since CQL3 requires it
    (JAVA-136)

* 1.0.1:
  - [api] Function call handling in the query builder has been modified in a
    backward incompatible way. Function calls are not parsed from string values
    anymore as this wasn't safe. Instead the new 'fcall' method should be used
    (JAVA-100).
  - [api] Some typos in method names in PoolingOptions have been fixed in a
    backward incompatible way before the API get widespread.
  - [bug] Don't destroy composite partition key with BoundStatement and
    TokenAwarePolicy (JAVA-123).
  - [new] null values support in the query builder.
  - [new] SSL support (requires C* >= 1.2.1) (JAVA-5).
  - [new] Allow generating unlogged batch in the query builder (JAVA-113).
  - [improvement] Better error message when no host are available.
  - [improvement] Improves performance of the stress example application been.

* 1.0.0:
  - [api] The AuthInfoProvider has be (temporarily) removed. Instead, the
    Cluster builder has a new withCredentials() method to provide a username
    and password for use with Cassandra's PasswordAuthenticator. Custom
    authenticator will be re-introduced in a future version but are not
    supported at the moment.
  - [api] The isMetricsEnabled() method in Configuration has been replaced by
    getMetricsOptions(). An option to disabled JMX reporting (on by default)
    has been added.
  - [bug] Don't make default load balancing policy a static singleton since it
    is stateful (JAVA-91).

* 1.0.0-RC1:
  - [new] Null values are now supported in BoundStatement (but you will need at
    least Cassandra 1.2.3 for it to work). The API of BoundStatement has been
    slightly changed so that not binding a variable is not an error anymore,
    the variable is simply considered null by default. The isReady() method has
    been removed (JAVA-79).
  - [improvement] The Cluster/Session shutdown methods now properly block until
    the shutdown is complete. A version with at timeout has been added (JAVA-75).
  - [bug] Fix use of CQL3 functions in the query builder (JAVA-44).
  - [bug] Fix case where multiple schema changes too quickly wouldn't work
    (only triggered when 0.0.0.0 was use for the rpc_address on the Cassandra
    nodes) (JAVA-77).
  - [bug] Fix IllegalStateException thrown due to a reconnection made on an I/O
    thread (JAVA-72).
  - [bug] Correctly reports errors during authentication phase (JAVA-82).

* 1.0.0-beta2:
  - [new] Support blob constants, BigInteger, BigDecimal and counter batches in
    the query builder (JAVA-51, JAVA-60, JAVA-58)
  - [new] Basic support for custom CQL3 types (JAVA-61)
  - [new] Add "execution infos" for a result set (this also move the query
    trace in the new ExecutionInfos object, so users of beta1 will have to
    update) (JAVA-65)
  - [bug] Fix failover bug in DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy (JAVA-62)
  - [bug] Fix use of bind markers for routing keys in the query builder
    (JAVA-66)

* 1.0.0-beta1:
  - initial release
