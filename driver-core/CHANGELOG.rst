  add latency awareness to a wrapped load balancing policy (JAVA-129).
- [new] Allow defering cluster initialization (Cluster.Builder#deferInitialization)
  (JAVA-161)

  authenticator will be re-introduced in a future version but are not
  supported at the moment.
- [api] The isMetricsEnabled() method in Configuration has been replaced by
  getMetricsOptions(). An option to disabled JMX reporting (on by default)
  has been added.
- [bug] Don't make default load balancing policy a static singleton since it
  is stateful (JAVA-91).


1.0.0-RC1:
----------

- [new] Null values are now supported in BoundStatement (but you will need at
  least Cassandra 1.2.3 for it to work). The API of BoundStatement has been
  slightly changed so that not binding a variable is not an error anymore,
  the variable is simply considered null by default. The isReady() method has
  been removed (JAVA-79).

- [bug] Fix case where multiple schema changes too quickly wouldn't work
  (only triggered when 0.0.0.0 was use for the rpc_address on the Cassandra

  trace in the new ExecutionInfos object, so users of beta1 will have to
  update) (JAVA-65)
- [bug] Fix failover bug in DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy (JAVA-62)
- [bug] Fix use of bind markers for routing keys in the query builder
  (JAVA-66)
