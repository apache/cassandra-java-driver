Driver Core
===========

This is the core module of the DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra (C*), 
which offers a simple (as in, not abstracted) but complete API to work with
CQL3. The main goal of the module is to handle all the functionality related
to managing connections to a Cassandra cluster (but leaving higher level
abstraction like object mapping to separate modules).


Features
--------

The features provided by the core module includes:
  - Asynchronous: the driver uses the new CQL binary protocol asynchronous
    capabilities. Only a relatively low number of connections per nodes needs to
    be maintained open to achieve good performance.
  - Nodes discovery: the driver automatically discovers and uses all nodes of the
    C* cluster, including newly bootstrapped ones.
  - Configurable load balancing: the driver allows for custom routing and load
    balancing of queries to C* nodes. Out of the box, round robin is provided
    with optional data-center awareness (only nodes from the local data-center
    are queried (and have connections maintained to)) and optional token
    awareness (that is, the ability to prefer a replica for the query as coordinator).
  - Transparent fail-over: if C* nodes fail or become unreachable, the driver
    automatically and transparently tries other nodes and schedules
    reconnection to the dead nodes in the background.
  - C* trace handling: tracing can be set on a per-query basis and the driver
    provides a convenient API to retrieve the trace.
  - Convenient schema access: the driver exposes a C* schema in a usable way.
  - Configurable retry policy: a retry policy can be set to define a precise
    behavior to adopt on query execution exceptions (for example, timeouts, 
    unavailability). This avoids polluting client code with retry-related code.


Prerequisite
------------

The driver uses Casandra's native protocol which is available starting from
Cassandra 1.2. Some of the features (result set paging, BatchStatement, ...) of
this version 2.0 of the driver require Cassandra 2.0 however and will throw
'unsupported feature' exceptions if used against a Cassandra 1.2 cluster.

If you are having issues connecting to the cluster (seeing ``NoHostAvailableConnection``
exceptions) please check the `connection requirements <https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/wiki/Connection-requirements>`_.

If you want to run the unit tests provided with this driver, you will also need
to have ccm installed (http://github.com/pcmanus/ccm) as the tests use it. Also
note that the first time you run the tests, ccm will download/compile the
source of C* under the hood, which may require some time (that depends on your
Internet connection or machine).


Installing
----------

The last release of the driver is available on Maven Central. You can install
it in your application using the following Maven dependency::

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>
      <artifactId>cassandra-driver-core</artifactId>
      <version>2.1.4</version>
    </dependency>


Upgrading from 1.x branch
-------------------------

If you are upgrading from the 1.x branch of the driver, be sure to have a look at
the `upgrade guide <https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/2.0/driver-core/Upgrade_guide_to_2.0.rst>`_.

We used the opportunity of a major version bump to incorporate your feedback and improve the API, 
to fix a number of inconsistencies and remove cruft. 
Unfortunately this means there are some breaking changes, but the new API should be both simpler and more complete.


Getting Started
---------------

Suppose you have a Cassandra cluster running on 3 nodes whose hostnames are:
cass1, cass2 and cass3. A simple example using this core driver could be::

    Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder()
                        .addContactPoints("cass1", "cass2")
                        .build();
    Session session = cluster.connect("db1");

    for (Row row : session.execute("SELECT * FROM table1"))
        // do something ...

Please note that when we build the Cluster object, we only provide the address
to 2 Cassandra hosts. We could have provided only one host or the 3 of them,
this doesn't matter as long as the driver is able to contact one of the host
provided as "contact points". Even if only one host was provided, the driver
would use this host to discover the other ones and use the whole cluster
automatically. This is also true for new nodes joining the cluster.

For now, please refer to the API reference (http://www.datastax.com/drivers/java/apidocs/).
More informations and documentation will come later.
