= Reference configuration

The following is a copy of the `reference.conf` file matching the
version of this documentation. It is packaged in the `java-driver-core`
JAR artifact, and used at runtime to provide the default values for all
configuration options (in the sources, it can be found under
`core/src/main/resources`).

See the xref:core/configuration.adoc[configuration page] for more explanations.
