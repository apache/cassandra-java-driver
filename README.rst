DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra
=========================================

A Java client driver for Apache Cassandra. This driver works exclusively with
the Cassandra Query Language version 3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's binary protocol.

- JIRA: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA
- MAILING LIST: https://groups.google.com/a/lists.datastax.com/forum/#!forum/java-driver-user
- IRC: #datastax-drivers on `irc.freenode.net <http://freenode.net>`_
- DOCS: http://www.datastax.com/documentation/developer/java-driver/1.0/webhelp/index.html
- API: http://www.datastax.com/drivers/java/apidocs


The driver architecture is based on layers. At the bottom lies the driver core.
This core handles everything related to the connections to a Cassandra
cluster (for example, connection pool, discovering new nodes, etc.) and exposes a simple,
relatively low-level API on top of which higher level layer can be built.

The driver contains the following modules:
 - driver-core: the core layer.
 - driver-examples: example applications using the other modules which are
   only meant for demonstration purposes.

More modules including a simple object mapper will come shortly.

Please refer to the README of each module for more information.


Maven
-----

The last release of the driver is available on Maven Central. You can install
it in your application using the following Maven dependency::

      <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>
      <artifactId>cassandra-driver-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.2</version>
    </dependency>
    
**DSE users** should use the following Maven dependency (*note the version is set to 1.0.2-dse2*)::

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>
      <artifactId>cassandra-driver-core</artifactId>

    </dependency>
