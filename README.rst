DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra
=========================================

A Java client driver for Apache Cassandra. This driver works exclusively with
the Cassandra Query Language version 3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's binary protocol.

- JIRA: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA
- MAILING LIST: https://groups.google.com/a/lists.datastax.com/forum/#!forum/java-driver-user
- IRC: #datastax-drivers on `irc.freenode.net <http://freenode.net>`_

- DOCS: http://www.datastax.com/documentation/developer/java-driver/2.0/index.html
- API: http://www.datastax.com/drivers/java/2.0


The driver architecture is based on layers. At the bottom lies the driver core.
This core handles everything related to the connections to a Cassandra
cluster (for example, connection pool, discovering new nodes, etc.) and exposes a simple,
relatively low-level API on top of which higher level layer can be built.

The driver contains the following modules:
 - driver-core: the core layer.
 - driver-examples: example applications using the other modules which are
   only meant for demonstration purposes.

More modules including a simple object mapper will come shortly.

Please refer to the README of each module for more information.


Maven
-----

The last release of the driver is available on Maven Central. You can install
it in your application using the following Maven dependency::

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>
      <artifactId>cassandra-driver-core</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

Compatibility
-------------

The Java client driver 2.0 (`branch 2.0 <https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/tree/2.0>`_) is compatible with Apache
Cassandra 1.2 and 2.0, but some features are available only when using Apache Cassandra 2.0 (e.g. result set paging,
`BatchStatement <https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/2.0/driver-core/src/main/java/com/datastax/driver/core/BatchStatement.java>`_, 
`lightweight transactions <http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_using/use_ltweight_transaction_t.html>`_ 
-- see `What's new in Cassandra 2.0 <http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/features/features_key_c.html>`_). 
Trying to use these with a cluster running Cassandra 1.2 will result in 
an `UnsupportedFeatureException <https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/2.0/driver-core/src/main/java/com/datastax/driver/core/exceptions/UnsupportedFeatureException.java>`_ being thrown.


Upgrading from 1.x branch
-------------------------


If you are upgrading from the 1.x branch of the driver, be sure to have a look at
the `upgrade guide <https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/2.0/driver-core/Upgrade_guide_to_2.0.rst>`_.

We used the opportunity of a major version bump to incorporate your feedback and improve the API, 
to fix a number of inconsistencies and remove cruft. 
Unfortunately this means there are some breaking changes, but the new API should be both simpler and more complete.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are having issues connecting to the cluster (seeing ``NoHostAvailableConnection`` exceptions) please check the 
`connection requirements <https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/wiki/Connection-requirements>`_.
