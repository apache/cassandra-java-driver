<!--
  Clirr is a tool that checks Java libraries for binary and source compatibility with older releases.

  This file lists known (and accepted) differences with the reference version specified in pom.xml.

  To update this file:
  * run `mvn clirr:clirr` at the root directory
  * check the reports in `<module>/target/site/clirr-report.html`
  * add new differences if needed. Difference types are explained at http://www.mojohaus.org/clirr-maven-plugin/examples/ignored-differences.html

  The formatter introduces line breaks that make Clirr unhappy:
