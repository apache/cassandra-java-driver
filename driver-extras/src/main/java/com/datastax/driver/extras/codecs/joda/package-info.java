/**
 * This package contains a collection of convenience {@link com.datastax.driver.core.TypeCodec
 * TypeCodec} instances useful for serializing between CQL types and Joda Time types such as {@link
 * org.joda.time.DateTime}.

 * <p>
 *
 * <p>Note that classes in this package require the presence of <a

 * can be done by declaring the following dependency in your project:
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * <dependency>
 *   <groupId>joda-time</groupId>
 *   <artifactId>joda-time</artifactId>
 *   <version>2.9.1</version>
