Datastax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra
=========================================

A Java client driver for Apache Cassandra. This driver works exclusively with
the Cassandra Query Language version 3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's binary protocol.

The driver architecture is based on layers. At the bottom lies the driver core.
This core handles everything related to the connections to the Cassandra
cluster (connection pool, discovering new nodes, ...) and exposes a simple,
relatively low-level, API on top of which higher level layer can build.

The driver contains the following modules:
 - driver-core: the core layer.
 - driver-mapping: ...
 - driver-examples: example applications using the other modules. Those are
   only meant for demonstration purposes.

Please refer to the README of each module for more information.
